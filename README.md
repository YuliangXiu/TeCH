TeCH considers image-based reconstruction as a conditional generation task, taking conditions from both the input image and the derived descriptions. It is capable of reconstructing "lifelike" 3D clothed humans. <strong>“Lifelike”</strong> refers to 1) a detailed full-body geometry, including facial features and clothing wrinkles, in both frontal and unseen regions, and 2) a high-quality texture with consistent color and intricate patterns.

## Installation

Please follow the [Installation Instruction](docs/install.md) to setup all the required packages.

## Getting Started

We provide a running script at `scripts/run.sh`. Before getting started, you need to set your own environment variables of `CUDA_HOME`.

After that, you can use TeCH to create a highly detailed clothed human textured mesh from a single image, for example:

```shell
sh scripts/run.sh input/examples/name.img exp/examples/name
```

The results will be saved in the experiment folder `exp/examples/name`, and the textured mesh will be saved as `exp/examples/name/obj/name_texture.obj`

It is noted that in "Step 3", the current version of Dreambooth implementation requires 2\*32G GPU memory. And 1\*32G GPU memory is efficient for other steps. The entire training process for a subject takes ~3 hours on our V100 GPUs.

## TODOs

- [ ] Release of evaluation protocols and results data for comparison (on CAPE & THUman 2.0 datasets).
- [ ] Switch to the diffuser version of DreamBooth to save training memory.
- [ ] Further improvement of efficiency and robustness.
