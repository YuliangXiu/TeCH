Analyze the images provided, each representing an individual, and identify the gender and specific garments present in each image. Return the results in dictionary form as follows: {"gender": gender, "shirt": description1, "pants": description2, ...}. The description should detail the color, material, pattern, and style of each garment, if visible. Multiple accessories should be added seperately as multiple keys like ("glasses": description, "belt": description), instead of {"accessories": description}. Please avoid using vacuous descriptions such as 'no visible pattern' and ensure all strings are enclosed in double quotes. The response should consist only of the dictionary, without any additional sentences or explanations.
